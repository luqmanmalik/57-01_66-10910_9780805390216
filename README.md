This is the second installment in Spivak's analysis sequence. A strong footing in _Calculus, A Hitchhiker's Guide to Calculus_, and the present text should prepare the serious student of mathematical analysis for Spivak's five–volume _Comprehensive introduction to Differential Geometry_. Mathematicians use to polorize over the supremecy of pure versus applied mathematics; that paradigm has all but vanished. Today, it is a question of algebra versus analysis. If one finds themself pivoting between the two, I have no doubt that an honest attempt at Spivak will settle the matter for them.

__Required tech()__ This repository is Safari–centric and designed on a 13" MacBook running OS X El Capitan. Given the simplex design of the page–frame (HTML_CSS, MathJax) versus the complex embedding of the carousel<sup>4</sup> main–frame (JS, PHP, c++), a browser–universal repository seems exessive and idyllic at this stage.

**Copyrighting** dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone and_or fork of each version of the source, a well–defined attribution ecology is formed within the repository's geneological record. Furthermore, by compiling the metadata of each version>clone>fork, one can analize the structural distance of that copy from the source. Therefore, [repo + metadata(repo) + License]::**authenticate**::autr(s_code).
